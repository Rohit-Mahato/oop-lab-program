ASSIGNMENT 2 STUDENT.
Develop an object oriented program in C++ to create a database of student
information system containing the following information: Name, Roll
number, Class, division, Date of Birth, Blood group, Contact address,
telephone number, driving license no. etc Construct the database with
suitable member functions for initializing and destroying the data viz
constructor, default constructor, Copy constructor, destructor, static member
functions, friend class, this pointer, inline code and dynamic memory
allocation operators-new and deletE

Assignment 1 complex no
Implement a class Complex which represents the Complex Number data type.
Implement the following
1. Constructor (including a default constructor which creates the complex
number 0+0i).
2. Overload operator+ to add two complex numbers.
3. Overload operator* to multiply two complex numbers.
4. Overload operators &lt;&lt; and &gt;&gt; to print and read Complex Numbers.

Title:- Implement a class Complex which represents the Complex Number data type.
Implement the following operations:
1. Constructor (including a default constructor which creates the complex number 0+0i).
2. Overloaded operator+ to add two complex numbers.
3. Overloaded operator* to multiply two complex numbers.
4. Overloaded << and >> to print and read Complex Numbers.

system containing the following information: Name, Roll number, Class, division, Date of Birth,
Blood group, Contact address, telephone number, driving license no. etc Construct the database
with suitable member functions for initializing and destroying the data viz constructor, default

Pract-3
Title:-Imagine a publishing company which does marketing for book and audiocassette versions.
Create a class publication that stores the title (a string) and price (type float) of a publication.
From this class derive two classes: book, which adds a page count (type int), and tape, which
adds a playing time in minutes (type float).Write a program that instantiates the book and tape
classes, allows user to enter data and displays the data members. If an exception is caught,
replace all the data member values with zero values.

Pract-4
Title: - Write a C++ program that creates an output file, writes information to it, closes the file
and open it again as an input file and read the information from the file.

Pract-5
Title: - Write a function template selection Sort. Write a program that inputs, sorts and outputs
an int array and a float array.

Pract-6
Title: -Write C++ program using STL for sorting and searching user defined records such as Item records
(Item code, name, cost, quantity etc) using vector container.

Pract-7
Title: -Write a program in C++ to use map associative container. The keys will be the names of states
and the values will be the populations of the states. When the program runs, the user is prompted to
type the name of a state. The program then looks in the map, using the state name as an index and
returns the population of the state.
